## Vitest / Vite config split (required)

Keep Vitest config in a **separate `vitest.config.ts`** — never embed a `test:` block in `vite.config.ts`.

**Why:** Vitest 3 bundles its own Vite 7, whose types conflict with this project's Vite 8. `tsconfig.node.json` only includes `vite.config.ts`, so a standalone `vitest.config.ts` is never processed by `tsc -b` and the type mismatch is avoided. Tracked in issues #15 (bug) and #16 (fix).

**Rules:**

- `vite.config.ts` must have no `test:` block and no `/// <reference types="vitest" />`
- `vitest.config.ts` must import `defineConfig` from `vitest/config` and own all `test` config
- Verify this before pushing any new CI workflow — violating it causes `tsc -b` to fail with `'test' does not exist in type 'UserConfigExport'`
